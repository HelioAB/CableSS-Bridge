 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.766   TIME= 23:12:31
 Coefficient ratio exceeds 1.0e8 - Check results.                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.000   TIME= 23:12:31
 A reference moment value times the tolerance is used by the             
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference MOMENT CONVERGENCE VALUE = 36604765.1 is less than a          
 threshold.  This threshold is internally calculated.  You can           
 overwrite it by specifying MINREF on the CNVTOL command.  Check         
 results carefully.
