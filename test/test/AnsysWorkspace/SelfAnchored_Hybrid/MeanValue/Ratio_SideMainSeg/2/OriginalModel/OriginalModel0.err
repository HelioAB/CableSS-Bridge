 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.875   TIME= 23:17:57
 Coefficient ratio exceeds 1.0e8 - Check results.                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.141   TIME= 23:17:57
 A reference moment value times the tolerance is used by the             
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference MOMENT CONVERGENCE VALUE = 511838665 is less than a           
 threshold.  This threshold is internally calculated.  You can           
 overwrite it by specifying MINREF on the CNVTOL command.  Check         
 results carefully.

 The ETABLE command has requested item = SMISC, comp = 2 of element 1153 
 (element type LINK10).  0.0 is output, as this component is not         
 available.  Checking for this discontinues.
