 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.781   TIME= 23:09:18
 Coefficient ratio exceeds 1.0e8 - Check results.                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.969   TIME= 23:09:19
 A reference moment value times the tolerance is used by the             
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference MOMENT CONVERGENCE VALUE = 187543513 is less than a           
 threshold.  This threshold is internally calculated.  You can           
 overwrite it by specifying MINREF on the CNVTOL command.  Check         
 results carefully.
