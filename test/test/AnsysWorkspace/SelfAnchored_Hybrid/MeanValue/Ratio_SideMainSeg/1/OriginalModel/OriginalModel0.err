 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.672   TIME= 10:59:42
 Coefficient ratio exceeds 1.0e8 - Check results.                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.875   TIME= 10:59:43
 A reference moment value times the tolerance is used by the             
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference MOMENT CONVERGENCE VALUE = 70027291.2 is less than a          
 threshold.  This threshold is internally calculated.  You can           
 overwrite it by specifying MINREF on the CNVTOL command.  Check         
 results carefully.
