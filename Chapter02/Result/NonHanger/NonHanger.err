 A reference moment value times the tolerance is used by the             
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference MOMENT CONVERGENCE VALUE = 279077456 is less than a           
 threshold.  This threshold is internally calculated.  You can           
 overwrite it by specifying MINREF on the CNVTOL command.  Check         
 results carefully.
